# 💡 Idea

Use a PS5 controller to replace the keyboard and mouse so I can sit back and relax on the couch while using my laptop—like a boss. 😎

The right button toggles **Insert Mode**, just like in Vim.

* **Insert Mode** = Keyboard mode (joystick types characters)
* **Normal Mode** (not Insert) = Mouse mode (joystick moves the cursor)

# 🎮 Keymap

I’ve set up some default mappings, but haven’t had time to fully optimize them yet.

Feel free to tweak it to suit your own workflow! 😊
